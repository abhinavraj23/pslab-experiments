# Measuring Resistance using Multimeter in PSLab

## Learning Objective
1. To learn how to measure resistance and voltage in PSLab.
2. To learn about Series and Parallel combination of resistances.

## Required Components

 1. PSLab device
 2. OTG Cable
 3. Multiple resistors
 4. Connecting wires
## Required Instruments
Multimeter

## Schematics
#### In Series

Connect the two resistors in series as shown below

#### In Parallel

Parallel connection is to be made in this manner

## Step by step tutorial
#### General Steps for resistance measurement

 1. Take a resistance and connect it to any two pins of breadboard
 2. Connect one end to the sen pin and the other end to the GND pin of PSLab device.
 3. Connect the PSLab to the android through the OTG cable.
 4. Now go to the Android app and select multimeter instrument.
 5. Now in the multimeter instrument set the knob to resistance, in the measure section.
 6. Now click on the read button and then it will show the resistance of the resistor.

#### For Series

 1. Take two resistances and measure the resistance individually 
 2. Now connect the resistances in series following the schematics
 3. Now again measure the resistance and record the reading.

#### For Parallel

 1. Take two resistances and measure the resistance individually 
 2. Now connect the resistances in parallel following the schematics
 3. Now again measure the resistance and record the reading.


## Observation
#### For Series

You will observe that the total resistance measured when combined will be the sum of the individual resistances.

Thus we conclude that in case of series resistance Rtotal = R1+R2
#### For Parallel

You will observe that the reciprocal of the total resistance measured when combined in parallel will be the sum of the reciprocal of individual resistances

Thus we conclude that in case of parallel resistance
